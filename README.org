#+TITLE: Lab 01: creating a simple OpenGL application
#+SUBTITLE: PROG2002 -- Graphics Programming -- Autumn 2020
#+AUTHOR: Ahmed Mohammed, Christopher Frantz, Rafael Palomar, and Mekides Assefa

* Introduction

This lab will be the first contact with some of the libraries that will be used
during the course. The objectives of the lab are:

- Creating a simple OpenGL project
- Display simple 2D patterns

You are free to use any operating system, however the instructions of this lab
are only available for Microsoft Windows and GNU/Linux systems (mostly
debian-based). MS Windows users should download the 64-bit version of the
binaries and, whenever possible, choose the development versions.

* Pre-requisites

- OpenGL >= 4.3 :: OpenGL is the industry&rsquo;s most widely used, supported
  and best documented 2D/3D graphics API making it inexpensive and easy to obtain
  information on implementing OpenGL in hardware and software. You should try to
  get the latest graphics drivers available for your platform. On MS Windows,
  the header files will be bundled with your compiler; on GNU/Linux
  (debian-based systems) it is needed to install the =mesa-common-dev= package.

- GLFW >= 3.3.1 :: GLFW is an Open Source, multi-platform library for OpenGL,
  OpenGL ES and Vulkan development on the desktop. It provides a simple API for
  creating windows, contexts and surfaces, receiving input and events. It can be
  downloaded from https://www.glfw.org/ or using your package manager
  =libglfw3, libglfw3-dev=. in Debian-based systems.

- GLEW-2.1.0 :: The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (GLEW) is a cross-platform
  open-source C/C++ extension loading library. GLEW provides efficient run-time
  mechanisms for determining which OpenGL extensions are supported on the target
  platform. OpenGL core and extension functionality is exposed in a single
  header file. GLEW has been tested on a variety of operating systems, including
  Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, Irix, and Solaris. It can be downloaded
  from http://glew.sourceforge.net/ or using your package manager
  =libglew-dev=.


* Instructions for Windows

We will be using visual studio 2017/2019

1. Download Important Libraries

- GLFW 64/32 bit, depending on the platform you want to support. [prebuilt binaries](https://www.glfw.org/download.html)
- GLEW 64/32 bit, depending on the platform you want to support. [prebuilt binaries](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)

2. Create a new visual studio C++ project â€“ Empty project

- Use your preferred location (plocation) and project name (pname)
- In your project folder( at plocation), create a new folder for your source files (src) and dependencies (Dependency): 
    - right click on the project solution name
    - choose Add -> New Folder
- In your src folder, Add -> New Item -> C++ file
    - write and save the provided main.cpp code.

3. Linking the libraries

- Create GLFW and GLEW folders in the projects Dependencies folder 
- Go to the downloaded GLFW/GLEW pre-built binary folders
- Copy the include and lib folders (lib-vc2017 or 2019 for GLFW)
- Paste them in their corresponding Dependencies folders.
- Open your project's property page: 
- Right click on the project solution name -> properties
- For all configurations and your chosen platform, add additional include directories 
    - go to C/C++ -> General setting -> Additional Include Directories
    - add the path to the GLFW and GLEW include files. 
    
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$(SourceDir)Dependencies\GLFW\include;
$(SourceDir)Dependencies\GLEW\include
#+END_SRC
    
    - go to C/C++ -> Preprocessors -> Preprocessor definitions and add GLEW_STATIC

- For all configurations and your chosen platform, add linkers for your libraries
    - Go to Linkers -> General -> Additional Library Directories
    - Add the path to your libraries

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$(SourceDir)Dependencies\GLFW\lib-vc2017 or 2019;
$(SourceDir)Dependencies\GLEW\lib\Release\Win32 or x64
#+END_SRC

    - Go to input -> include the libraries in the Additional Dependencies section.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
glfw3.lib;opengl32.lib;glew32s.lib
#+END_SRC

Now, you can start building and compiling your main.cpp file.

* Instructions for Linux

This instructions should work on recent Debian-based systems, for other
distributions try to find the appropriated name for the packages in your package
manager.

1. Install the libraries

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
apt install libglfw3 libglfw3-dev mesa-common-dev libglew-dev
#+END_SRC

2. Create and copy your application (=main.cpp=)

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
g++ main.cpp -o lab01 -lGL -lGLEW -lglfw
#+END_SRC

* Tasks

** Task 0: Initial setup

 - Install your development environment and the required libraries. If there is
   no special reason to use 32-bits version, we recommend to use 64-bit versions
   of the libraries.

 - Update your graphics drivers.

** Task 1: Create your first window and OpenGL context with GLFW

- Create a simple =main.cpp= that creates a GLFW window.
- Keep the window alive until the user presses the =escape= key.
- Make sure to capture and inform the user about any possible error derived from
  the initialization of GLFW or the creation of the window.
- Make sure to properly terminate the application when the user closes the
  application.
- Make the OpenGL context current.

** Task 2: Initialize GLEW and clear the screen

- Use OpenGL basic functions to set the backround of the window to a color of
  your choice.

** Task 3: Create your first triangle and display it on the screen.

- Initiailze GLEW and make sure to capture and inform the user about any
  possible error.
- Print the OpenGL version.
- Create a triangle geometry based no the coordinates of its vertices.
- Transfer triangle definition to OpenGL buffers and display the triangle.
- Create a simple vertex shader that forwards the vertex coordinates as they
  are.
- Create a simple fragment shader that sets the triangle to a color of choice.
- Try changing the position and color of the triangle using shaders.
